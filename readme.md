Angular Brunch Base Coffeescript
=====

This project template sets up a basic project build using Brunch. the components contained are:

* Angular
* Bootstrap 3
* Angular-Bootstrap
* Angular-UI-Rooter

It also sets up a set up a simple application frame with a three column layout and a header and footer using UI router named views.

To use it, clone the project and run *npm install* and *bower install*. You then should be able to build the project with *brunch build* or *brunch watch*. Ensure you have NodeJs installed before you start.

The brunch build includes *auto-reload*. To use it you need to use some web server. The IntelliJ / Webstorm built in server works fine.
