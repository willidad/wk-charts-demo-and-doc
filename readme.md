It also sets up a set up a simple application frame with a three column layout and a header and footer using UI router named views.

Make sure that you have NodeJs, Bower and Brunch installed before you start.

To use it, clone the project and run *npm install* and *bower install*. You then should be able to build the project with *brunch build* or *brunch watch*.

The brunch build includes *auto-reload*. To use it you need to use some web server. The IntelliJ / Webstorm built in server works fine.
